% ============================================================================
% Embedded Systems Best Practices:
%   - Precompute and cache axis normals for each bounding box once, not per collision
%   - Use fixed-size arrays and avoid dynamic concatenation in getAxes
%   - Vectorize polygon projection using matrix multiplications
%   - Implement overlap checks with direct min/max comparisons (no temporary arrays)
%   - Remove debug traces; guard any logging under a verbosity flag
%   - Align data in column-major order for efficient memory access
%   - Consider using bitmasks for axis selection to reduce operations
%   - Offload compute-intensive loops to MEX/C for high-performance applications
% ============================================================================
% Module Interface
% Methods:
%   checkCollision(obj, corners1, corners2): returns collision boolean using SAT
%   WhoIsBulletVehicle(obj, vehicle1, vehicle2, collisionType): identifies bullet and target vehicles
%
% Dependencies:
%   getAxes (private)
%
% Bottlenecks:
%   - Loop over edges to compute axes (8 axes), dynamic concatenation
%   - unique(axes, 'rows') overhead
%   - Projection loops per axis
%
% Proposed Optimizations:
%   - Compute and store axes for static vehicle shapes to avoid repeated recomputation
%   - Vectorize projection via matrix multiplication: projection = corners * axis'
%   - Limit axes to minimal necessary (4 unique normals) rather than all edges
%   - Inline simple overlap checks with direct min/max operations avoiding intermediate arrays
